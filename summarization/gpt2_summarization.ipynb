spinster Miss Delmar , the aunt of the earl de Versely and Captain Delmar . Miss Delmar invites Arabella Mason , the daughter of a deceased , well-liked steward to stay with her as a lower-class guest in the house . Captain Delmar is known to visit his aunt at Madeline Hall frequently , accompanied by his valet Ben Keene , who is also a private marine . Captain Delmar eventually suggests that Ben should propose to Arabella , and the two marry in secret , to the frustration of Miss Delmar and Arabella s mother . The captain is able to smooth over the situation with his aunt , even after it is discovered that Arabella was six months pregnant at the time of the marriage . She later gives birth to a boy , who takes the Captain s Christian name and Ben s surname -- the titular Percival Keene . The family moves to Chatham , after Ben is ordered back with his detachment . Arabella opens up a successful shop and circulating library below her house , enlisting the help of her mother and sister , Amelia . Percival becomes well known in town from his mischievous pranks on officers and other strangers , often encouraged by his aunt Amelia . However , Percival s mother and grandmother are less fond of his disregard for manners , and insist on sending him to school after an episode in which he bites his grandmother . Percival reports to the school house of Mr. O'Gallagher , a poor Irish scholar , who rules his class with a system of severe corporal punishment . Mr. O'Gallagher routinely bullies Percival by stealing his lunch , leading Percival to seek revenge by poisoning his sandwiches with calomel . On Guy Fawkes Day the schoolteacher confiscates all the schoolboys ' fireworks , for which Percival retaliates by setting off the collected fireworks while the teacher sits above them , leading to the total destruction of the schoolhouse and near death of the schoolmaster . When Percival is a young teenager , Captain Delmar reappears and offers him a position aboard his new navy ship , the H.M. Calliope . While preparing to enter service , Percival overhears gossip of his illegitimate birth , introducing the idea that Captain Delmar may be his father . He confronts his mother about his parentage , which she at first harshly denies but later tearfully explains the truth of her affair . Early in his service in the navy , Percival is captured during a pirate raid along with others . The pirate crew is entirely black , and the captain explains that they are primarily escaped slaves from the Americas . Percival is taken in as a cabin boy , and later dyes his skin tan in the appearance of a mulatto to please the captain who does n't approve of white skin . The pirates often seek to take over slave trading vessels , killing every white person on board . During the taking of one such vessel , Percival is able is convince the captain to spare the lives of a wealthy Dutch merchant and his young daughter , Minnie . Eventually the H.M. Calliope takes the pirate ship , and Percival -- unrecognizable with his dyed skin -- is taken as a prisoner , later to convince his fellow shipman of his true identity . After his reappearance aboard the ship , Percival gains esteem among the crew and is welcomed back by the emotional Captain Delmar . His reputation continues to grow over the course of his service in conflicts with Dutch and French vessels around the island of Curacao . He also stands in for an ill Captain Delmar in a duel with a French officer , effectively saving the captain s life . At this point , the captain receives news that his older brother has died , making him the new Lord de Versely , and before returning to England he grants Perceval command of his own schooner . After another intense but successful battle with a French war ship , Percival is promoted to captain . During his service in the Navy , Percival still partakes in the merry pranks of his youth , and at one point teams up with a mulatto hotel owner in Curaรงao to convince his fellow officers they ve been poisoned . He also keeps correspondence with Minnie , developing a romance with the beautiful heiress . Near the end of the story , Percival guides his crew through a terrible storm in which many of the crew are killed and the ship is heavily damaged . After being saved by another English vessel , he receives a letter informing him of Lord de Versely s sudden death from heart complications and learns that he has been left all of his personal property . Percival is still disappointed that he can not take his father s name . He later journey s with his friend Bob Cross to Hamburg to reunite with Minnie , but is captured by French troops on the road and sentenced to execution for spying . During a skirmish between the French and the Cossacks , Percival and Cross are able to escape and continue on the road . At the end of the novel , Percival proposes to Minnie , and stands to inherit a great fortune through her father . He also receives a letter from the de Versely attorney letting him know he has been granted the arms and name of Delmar .\n","A scholar and explorer , Dr. Samuel Ferguson , accompanied by his manservant Joe and his friend professional hunter Richard Dick Kennedy , sets out to travel across the African continent — still not fully explored — with the help of a balloon filled with hydrogen . He has invented a mechanism that , by eliminating the need to release gas or throw ballast overboard to control his altitude , allows very long trips to be taken . This voyage is meant to link together the voyages of Sir Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke in East Africa with those of Heinrich Barth in the regions of the Sahara and Chad . The trip begins in Zanzibar on the east coast , and passes across Lake Victoria , Lake Chad , Agadez , Timbuktu , Djenné and Ségou to St Louis in modern-day Senegal on the west coast . The book describes the unknown interior of Africa near modern-day Central African Republic as a desert , when it is actually savanna . A good deal of the initial exploration is to focus on the finding of the source of the Nile , an event that occurs in chapter 18 ( out of 43 ) . The second leg is to link up the other explorers . There are numerous scenes of adventure , composed of either a conflict with a native or a conflict with the environment . Some examples include : Rescuing of a missionary from a tribe that was preparing to sacrifice him . Running out of water while stranded , windless , over the Sahara . An attack on the balloon by condors , leading to a dramatic action as Joe leaps out of the balloon . The actions taken to rescue Joe later . Narrowly escaping the remnants of a militant army as the balloon dwindles to nothingness with the loss of hydrogen . An anachronistic killing of a Bluebuck antelope , a species which was already extinct . * In all these adventures , the protagonists overcome by continued perseverance more than anything else . The novel is filled with coincidental moments where trouble is avoided because wind catches up at just the right time , or the characters look in just the right direction . There are frequent references to a higher power watching out for them . The balloon itself ultimately fails before the end , but makes it far enough across to get the protagonists to friendly lands , and eventually back to England , therefore succeeding in the expedition . The story abruptly ends after the African trip , with only a brief synopsis of what follows .\n","The story begins when a female lovely named Olivia , having fled captivity from the city of Akif , is chased down and cornered in a marsh , on the edge of the Vilayet Sea . Her pursuer and former master is a sadistic rogue named Shah Amurath . But before he can lay hands on her , a figure rises from the reeds . The newcomer has seen all his friends betrayed and treacherously cut down to a man before escaping into the marshes . There he has hidden out for so long he is nearly mad . The newcomer quickly dispatches Shah Amurath , then he and Olivia hop in a boat and decide to lie low for a little while . Only then does the newcomer identify himself : Conan the Cimmerian . Conan and Olivia find their way to a dark and apparently deserted island , where they spend the night sleeping in ancient ruins decorated with remarkably lifelike statues . Olivia has a dream in which she sees a band of men turned into those statues and wakes convinced they will come to life in the moonlight . Conan is less than convinced of Olivia s fears ; he is more concerned by whatever it is lurking in the jungle , lobbing giant boulders at the two fugitives . A pirate ship makes port on the island . Leaving Olivia hidden in the brush , Conan challenges their captain , an old rival . He slays the pirate captain , but is knocked unconscious by a stone from a sling . The pirates bind him and take him with them to the ruins where they discuss his fate , until they pass out drunk . Olivia meanwhile , narrowly escapes from a massive and dark figure that pursues her up to the ruins . Olivia sneaks past the drunken and sleeping pirates and frees Conan . Conan then slays the dark figure that pursued Olivia , a giant man-ape , which had also been hurling the boulders at them . As Conan recovers from his battle with the man-ape , they hear the beginning of a horrific slaughter back at the ruins . The two quickly head back to the deserted pirate ship . As Conan prepares the ship to sail , a band of beaten and bedraggled pirates comes and asks to come aboard and leave the devil island . Conan challenges them and they accept him as their captain . At the end Olivia begs Conan to allow her to stay with him , and he , laughing , accepts , saying he will make her Queen of the Blue Sea .\n","Chev Chelios ( Jason Statham ) is a Los Angeles-based British hitman , working for a crime syndicate headed by Carlito ( Carlos Sanz ) . Chelios is contracted by Carlito to kill mafia boss Don Kim ( Keone Young ) as members of the Triads have been encroaching on Carlito s business . Chelios goes to Don Kim and apparently murders him . However , Ricky Verona ( Jose Pablo Cantillo ) , an ambitious small-time criminal uses the opportunity to conspire with Carlito against Chelios ; Verona will kill Chelios so the Triads do not retaliate , and then take Chelios s place as Carlito s new hired gun . The morning after Don Kim s death , while Chelios sleeps in his apartment , Verona , his brother Alex ( Jay Xcala ) , and several henchmen break in and inject Chelios with a Chinese synthetic drug which inhibits the flow of adrenaline , slowing the heart and eventually killing the victim . Chelios wakes to find a recording left by Verona showing what he has done . In anger , Chelios smashes his TV and heads out . Chelios phones Mafia surgeon Doc Miles ( Dwight Yoakam ) , who informs Chelios that in order to survive he must keep his adrenaline pumping through constant excitement and danger , and he is unsure if the antidote exists . Chelios keeps his adrenaline up through reckless and dangerous acts like picking fights with other gangsters , taking illegal drugs and synthetic epinephrine , fighting with police , stealing a police officer s motorcycle , having public sex with his girlfriend Eve ( Amy Smart ) , and driving his car through a shopping mall . Chelios visits Carlito at his penthouse and asks him to help find an antidote , as well as to find and kill Verona and his crew . Carlito says there is no antidote and only confirms that Carlito and Verona are working together . Carlito tells Chelios how he will use his death as a scapegoat against the Chinese . An angered Chelios leaves Carlito s penthouse to find Verona . Through Chelios ' street contact , a transvestite named Kaylo ( Efren Ramirez ) , he finds Alex at a restaurant and unsuccessfully interrogates him about his brother s whereabouts before killing him . Chelios phones Verona through Alex s phone and tells him of his brother s death , prompting Verona to send thugs after Eve as a revenge . Chelios rushes to pick up Eve before Verona s thugs get to her . Chelios reveals his true profession to her and that he was planning to retire to spend more time with her . Kaylo , who has been kidnapped by Carlito s men , is forced to call Chelios and tell him that Verona is at a Triad warehouse . Chelios goes there , finding Kaylo s corpse and the henchmen . They reveal that Carlito ordered them to kill Chelios . Eve , who has followed Chelios , unexpectedly arrives , but then escapes with Chelios after a shootout with Carlito s henchmen . Chelios and Eve go to Doc Miles s place , where Miles explains that he can not cure Chelios . Knowing that he will die soon , Chelios decides to take his revenge on Verona and arranges a meeting with him at a downtown hotel . Chelios goes to the rooftop of the hotel and meets with Verona , Carlito , and his henchmen . Carlito takes out a syringe , filled with the same poison used by Verona . As he is about to kill Chelios by injecting the second dose into him , Don Kim , revealed to be alive as Chelios spared him , arrives with his Triads to assist Chelios and a shootout follows . During the battle , several of Don Kim s and all of Carlito s men are killed . Carlito tries to escape with his private helicopter , but Chelios manages to catch up to him and holds him at gunpoint . Before Chelios can kill Carlito , Verona sneaks behind and injects Chelios with the syringe , after which Chelios collapses . Carlito himself is betrayed by Verona , who shoots him to death and then tries to escape with his helicopter . Chelios manages to stand up , boards the helicopter , and engages in a fight with Verona . After some struggle , Chelios manages to pull Verona out of the helicopter and while mid-air , Chelios proceeds to snap Verona s neck , killing him . While falling , Chelios calls Eve on his cell phone to apologize for not coming back . Chelios hits a car , bounces off it and lands right in front of the camera . In the last shot , it is implied that his adrenaline is indeed still flowing fast ; his nostrils flare , he blinks , and two heartbeats are heard .\n","Crash Davis ( Costner ) , a veteran of 12 years in minor league baseball , is sent down to the single-A Durham Bulls for a specific purpose : to educate hotshot rookie pitcher Ebby Calvin LaLoosh ( Robbins , playing a character loosely based on Steve Dalkowski ) about becoming a major-league talent , and to control Ebby s haphazard pitching . Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of Meat , and they get off to a rocky start . Thrown into the mix is Annie ( Sarandon ) , a baseball groupie and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the Church of Baseball and has , every year , chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student . Annie flirts with both Crash and Ebby and invites them to her house , but Crash walks out , saying he s too much a veteran to try out for anything . Before he leaves , Crash further sparks Annie s interest with a memorable speech listing the things he believes in , ending with I believe in long , slow , deep , soft , wet kisses that last three days ... Good night . Despite some animosity between them , Annie and Crash work , in their own ways , to shape Ebby into a big-league pitcher . Annie plays mild bondage games , reads poetry to him , and gets him to think in different ways ( and gives him the nickname Nuke ) . Crash forces Nuke to learn not to think by letting the catcher make the pitching calls ( memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after Nuke rejects his calls ) , and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his heat ( fastballs ) . Crash also talks about the pleasure of life in The Show ( Major League Baseball ) , which he briefly lived for the 21 greatest days of my life and to which he has tried for years to return . Meanwhile , as Nuke matures , the relationship between Annie and Crash grows , until it becomes obvious that the two of them are a more appropriate match , except for the fact that Annie and Nuke are currently a couple . After a rough start , Nuke becomes a dominant pitcher by mid-season . By the end of the movie , Nuke is called up to the majors . This incites jealous anger in Crash , who is frustrated by Nuke s failure to recognize all the talent he was blessed with . Nuke leaves for the big leagues , Annie ends their relationship , and Crash overcomes his jealousy to leave Nuke with some final words of advice . The Bulls , now having no use for his mentor , release Crash . Crash then presents himself at Annie s house and the two consummate their attraction with a weekend-long lovemaking session . Crash then leaves Annie s house to seek a further minor-league position . Crash joins another team , the Asheville Tourists , and breaks the minor-league record for career home runs . We see Nuke one last time , being interviewed by the press as a major leaguer , reciting the clichĂŠd answers that Crash had taught him earlier . Crash then retires as a player and returns to Durham , where Annie tells him she s ready to give up her annual affairs with boys . Crash tells her that he is thinking about becoming a manager for a minor-league team in Visalia . The film ends with Annie and Crash dancing in Annie s candle-lit living room .\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ElH9c8PfQRPO","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":493},"outputId":"9359496d-ba6b-40eb-fa23-5edf76db8337","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1587525794844,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":250935,"user":{"displayName":"Eileen Cho","photoUrl":"","userId":"03381570147993013394"}}},"source":["for idx, row in temp.iterrows():\n","    t0 = time.time() # timer\n","    summary_temp_bart = summarizer_bart(str(row.summary_tokenized), min_length=1, max_length=80) # change min_ and max_length for different output\n","    print(\"Summarization took \" + str(round((time.time() - t0) / 60, 2)) + \" minutes.\")\n","    pp.pprint(summary_temp_bart[0]['summary_text'])"],"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Summarization took 0.59 minutes.\n","('Percival Keene is the son of Captain Delmar and Arabella Mason.

Miss Delmar invites Arabella Mason, the daughter of a deceased, well-liked steward to stay with her as a lower-class guest in the house. Captain Delmar is known to visit his aunt at Madeline Hall frequently, accompanied by his valet Ben Keene, who is also a private marine. Captain Delmar eventually suggests that Ben should propose to Arabella, and the two marry in secret, to the frustration of Miss Delmar and Arabella s mother. The captain is able to smooth over the situation with his aunt, even after it is discovered that Arabella was six months pregnant at the time of the marriage. She later gives birth to a boy, who takes the Captain s Christian name and Ben s surname -- the titular Percival Keene. The family moves to Chatham, after Ben is ordered back with his detachment. Arabella opens up a successful shop and circulating library below her house, enlisting the help of her mother and sister, Amelia. Percival becomes well known in town from his mischievous pranks on officers and other strangers, often encouraged by his aunt Amelia. However, Percival s mother and grandmother are less fond of his disregard for manners, and insist on sending him to school after an episode in which he bites his grandmother. Percival reports to the school house of Mr. O'Gallagher, a poor Irish scholar, who rules his class with a system of severe corporal punishment. Mr. O'Gallagher routinely bullies Percival by stealing his lunch, leading Percival to seek revenge by poisoning his sandwiches with calomel. On Guy Fawkes Day the schoolteacher confiscates all the schoolboys'fireworks, for which Percival retaliates by setting off the collected fireworks while the teacher sits above them, leading to the total destruction of the schoolhouse and near death of the schoolmaster. When Percival is a young teenager, Captain Delmar reappears and offers him a position aboard his new navy ship, the H.M. Calliope. While preparing to enter service, Percival overhears gossip of his illegitimate birth, introducing the idea that Captain Delmar may be his father. He confronts his mother about his parentage, which she at first harshly denies but later tearfully explains the truth of her affair. Early in his service in the navy, Percival is captured during a pirate raid along with others. The pirate crew is entirely black, and the captain explains that they are primarily escaped slaves from the Americas. Percival is taken in as a cabin boy, and later dyes his skin tan in the appearance of a mulatto to please the captain who doesn't approve of white skin. The pirates often seek to take over slave trading vessels, killing every white person on board. During the taking of one such vessel, Percival is able is convince the captain to spare the lives of a wealthy Dutch merchant and his young daughter, Minnie. Eventually the H.M. Calliope takes the pirate ship, and Percival -- unrecognizable with his dyed skin -- is taken as a prisoner, later to convince his fellow shipman of his true identity. After his reappearance aboard the ship, Percival gains esteem among the crew and is welcomed back by the emotional Captain Delmar. His reputation continues to grow over the course of his service in conflicts with Dutch and French vessels around the island of Curacao. He also stands in for an ill Captain Delmar in a duel with a French officer, effectively saving the captain s life. At this point, the captain receives news that his older brother has died, making him the new Lord de Versely, and before returning to England he grants Perceval command of his own schooner. After another intense but successful battle with a French war ship, Percival is promoted to captain. During his service in the Navy, Percival still partakes in the merry pranks of his youth, and at one point teams up with a mulatto hotel owner in Curaรงao to convince his fellow officers they ve been poisoned.

Near the end of the story, Percival guides his crew through a terrible storm in which many of the crew are killed and the ship is heavily damaged.

He has invented a mechanism that, by eliminating the need to release gas or throw ballast overboard to control his altitude, allows very long trips to be taken. This voyage is meant to link together the voyages of Sir Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke in East Africa with those of Heinrich Barth in the regions of the Sahara and Chad. The trip begins in Zanzibar on the east coast, and passes across Lake Victoria, Lake Chad, Agadez, Timbuktu, Djenné and Ségou to St Louis in modern-day Senegal on the west coast. The book describes the unknown interior of Africa near modern-day Central African Republic as a desert, when it is actually savanna. A good deal of the initial exploration is to focus on the finding of the source of the Nile, an event that occurs in chapter 18 ( out of 43 ). The second leg is to link up the other explorers. There are numerous scenes of adventure, composed of either a conflict with a native or a conflict with the environment. Some examples include : Rescuing of a missionary from a tribe that was preparing to sacrifice him. Running out of water while stranded, windless, over the Sahara. An attack on the balloon by condors, leading to a dramatic action as Joe leaps out of the balloon. The actions taken to rescue Joe later. Narrowly escaping the remnants of a militant army as the balloon dwindles to nothingness with the loss of hydrogen. An anachronistic killing of a Bluebuck antelope, a species which was already extinct. * In all these adventures, the protagonists overcome by continued perseverance more than anything else. The novel is filled with coincidental moments where trouble is avoided because wind catches up at just the right time, or the characters look in just the right direction. There are frequent references to a higher power watching out for them. The balloon itself ultimately fails before the end, but makes it far enough across to get the protagonists to friendly lands, and eventually back to England, therefore succeeding in the expedition. The story abruptly ends after the African trip, with only a brief synopsis of what follows.

The novel is filled with coincidental moments where trouble is avoided because wind catches up at just the right time, or the characters look in just the right direction. There are frequent references to a higher power watching out for them. The balloon itself ultimately fails before the end, but makes it far enough across to get the protagonists to friendly lands, and eventually back to England, therefore succeeding in the expedition. The story abruptly ends after the African trip, with only a brief synopsis of what follows. Summary:\n","Input:  The story begins when a female lovely named Olivia, having fled captivity from the city of Akif, is chased down and cornered in a marsh, on the edge of the Vilayet Sea. Her pursuer and former master is a sadistic rogue named Shah Amurath. But before he can lay hands on her, a figure rises from the reeds. The newcomer has seen all his friends betrayed and treacherously cut down to a man before escaping into the marshes. There he has hidden out for so long he is nearly mad. The newcomer quickly dispatches Shah Amurath, then he and Olivia hop in a boat and decide to lie low for a little while. Only then does the newcomer identify himself : Conan the Cimmerian. Conan and Olivia find their way to a dark and apparently deserted island, where they spend the night sleeping in ancient ruins decorated with remarkably lifelike statues. Olivia has a dream in which she sees a band of men turned into those statues and wakes convinced they will come to life in the moonlight. Conan is less than convinced of Olivia s fears ; he is more concerned by whatever it is lurking in the jungle, lobbing giant boulders at the two fugitives. A pirate ship makes port on the island. Leaving Olivia hidden in the brush, Conan challenges their captain, an old rival. He slays the pirate captain, but is knocked unconscious by a stone from a sling. The pirates bind him and take him with them to the ruins where they discuss his fate, until they pass out drunk. Olivia meanwhile, narrowly escapes from a massive and dark figure that pursues her up to the ruins. Olivia sneaks past the drunken and sleeping pirates and frees Conan. Conan then slays the dark figure that pursued Olivia, a giant man-ape, which had also been hurling the boulders at them. As Conan recovers from his battle with the man-ape, they hear the beginning of a horrific slaughter back at the ruins. The two quickly head back to the deserted pirate ship. As Conan prepares the ship to sail, a band of beaten and bedraggled pirates comes and asks to come aboard and leave the devil island. Conan challenges them and they accept him as their captain. At the end Olivia begs Conan to allow her to stay with him, and he, laughing, accepts, saying he will make her Queen of the Blue Sea.

Summary:\n","Input:  Chev Chelios ( Jason Statham ) is a Los Angeles-based British hitman, working for a crime syndicate headed by Carlito ( Carlos Sanz ). Chelios is contracted by Carlito to kill mafia boss Don Kim ( Keone Young ) as members of the Triads have been encroaching on Carlito s business. Chelios goes to Don Kim and apparently murders him. However, Ricky Verona ( Jose Pablo Cantillo ), an ambitious small-time criminal uses the opportunity to conspire with Carlito against Chelios ; Verona will kill Chelios so the Triads don't retaliate, and then take Chelios s place as Carlito s new hired gun. The morning after Don Kim s death, while Chelios sleeps in his apartment, Verona, his brother Alex ( Jay Xcala ), and several henchmen break in and inject Chelios with a Chinese synthetic drug which inhibits the flow of adrenaline, slowing the heart and eventually killing the victim. Chelios wakes to find a recording left by Verona showing what he has done. In anger, Chelios smashes his TV and heads out. Chelios phones Mafia surgeon Doc Miles ( Dwight Yoakam ), who informs Chelios that in order to survive he must keep his adrenaline pumping through constant excitement and danger, and he is unsure if the antidote exists. Chelios keeps his adrenaline up through reckless and dangerous acts like picking fights with other gangsters, taking illegal drugs and synthetic epinephrine, fighting with police, stealing a police officer s motorcycle, having public sex with his girlfriend Eve ( Amy Smart ), and driving his car through a shopping mall. Chelios visits Carlito at his penthouse and asks him to help find an antidote, as well as to find and kill Verona and his crew. Carlito says there is no antidote and only confirms that Carlito and Verona are working together. Carlito tells Chelios how he will use his death as a scapegoat against the Chinese. An angered Chelios leaves Carlito s penthouse to find Verona. Through Chelios'street contact, a transvestite named Kaylo ( Efren Ramirez ), he finds Alex at a restaurant and unsuccessfully interrogates him about his brother s whereabouts before killing him. Chelios phones Verona through Alex s phone and tells him of his brother s death, prompting Verona to send thugs after Eve as a revenge. Chelios rushes to pick up Eve before Verona s thugs get to her. Chelios reveals his true profession to her and that he was planning to retire to spend more time with her. Kaylo, who has been kidnapped by Carlito s men, is forced to call Chelios and tell him that Verona is at a Triad warehouse. Chelios goes there, finding Kaylo s corpse and the henchmen. They reveal that Carlito ordered them to kill Chelios. Eve, who has followed Chelios, unexpectedly arrives, but then escapes with Chelios after a shootout with Carlito s henchmen. Chelios and Eve go to Doc Miles s place, where Miles explains that he can not cure Chelios. Knowing that he will die soon, Chelios decides to take his revenge on Verona and arranges a meeting with him at a downtown hotel. Chelios goes to the rooftop of the hotel and meets with Verona, Carlito, and his henchmen. Carlito takes out a syringe, filled with the same poison used by Verona. As he is about to kill Chelios by injecting the second dose into him, Don Kim, revealed to be alive as Chelios spared him, arrives with his Triads to assist Chelios and a shootout follows. During the battle, several of Don Kim s and all of Carlito s men are killed. Carlito tries to escape with his private helicopter, but Chelios manages to catch up to him and holds him at gunpoint. Before Chelios can kill Carlito, Verona sneaks behind and injects Chelios with the syringe, after which Chelios collapses. Carlito himself is betrayed by Verona, who shoots him to death and then tries to escape with his helicopter. Chelios manages to stand up, boards the helicopter, and engages in a fight with Verona. After some struggle, Chelios manages to pull Verona out of the helicopter and while mid-air, Chelios proceeds to snap Verona s neck, killing him. While falling, Chelios calls Eve on his cell phone to apologize for not coming back. Chelios hits a car, bounces off it and lands right in front of the camera. In the last shot, it is implied that his adrenaline is indeed still flowing fast ; his nostrils flare, he blinks, and two heartbeats are heard.

Summary:\n","Input:  Crash Davis ( Costner ), a veteran of 12 years in minor league baseball, is sent down to the single-A Durham Bulls for a specific purpose : to educate hotshot rookie pitcher Ebby Calvin LaLoosh ( Robbins, playing a character loosely based on Steve Dalkowski ) about becoming a major-league talent, and to control Ebby s haphazard pitching. Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of Meat, and they get off to a rocky start. Thrown into the mix is Annie ( Sarandon ), a baseball groupie and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the Church of Baseball and has, every year, chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student. Annie flirts with both Crash and Ebby and invites them to her house, but Crash walks out, saying he s too much a veteran to try out for anything. Before he leaves, Crash further sparks Annie s interest with a memorable speech listing the things he believes in, ending with I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days... Good night. Despite some animosity between them, Annie and Crash work, in their own ways, to shape Ebby into a big-league pitcher. Annie plays mild bondage games, reads poetry to him, and gets him to think in different ways ( and gives him the nickname Nuke ). Crash forces Nuke to learn not to think by letting the catcher make the pitching calls ( memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after Nuke rejects his calls ), and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his heat ( fastballs ). Crash also talks about the pleasure of life in The Show ( Major League Baseball ), which he briefly lived for the 21 greatest days of my life and to which he has tried for years to return. Meanwhile, as Nuke matures, the relationship between Annie and Crash grows, until it becomes obvious that the two of them are a more appropriate match, except for the fact that Annie and Nuke are currently a couple. After a rough start, Nuke becomes a dominant pitcher by mid-season. By the end of the movie, Nuke is called up to the majors. This incites jealous anger in Crash, who is frustrated by Nuke s failure to recognize all the talent he was blessed with. Nuke leaves for the big leagues, Annie ends their relationship, and Crash overcomes his jealousy to leave Nuke with some final words of advice. The Bulls, now having no use for his mentor, release Crash. Crash then presents himself at Annie s house and the two consummate their attraction with a weekend-long lovemaking session. Crash then leaves Annie s house to seek a further minor-league position. Crash joins another team, the Asheville Tourists, and breaks the minor-league record for career home runs. We see Nuke one last time, being interviewed by the press as a major leaguer, reciting the clichĂŠd answers that Crash had taught him earlier. Crash then retires as a player and returns to Durham, where Annie tells him she s ready to give up her annual affairs with boys. Crash tells her that he is thinking about becoming a manager for a minor-league team in Visalia. The film ends with Annie and Crash dancing in Annie s candle-lit living room.
